Getting Started
================

Unfortunately you cant make custom mods in game, you have to do that in the Unity Editor. Most 2021.2 LTS version should be compatible, Banana Shooter currently uses 2021.3.21f1c1. `View Download Links <https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.0>`_

Once Unity is installed, a project can be created to make custom mods(make sure to choose URP on the create project menu because BS is currently using URP so if your materials arent using the urp shader than it might can not be loaded in the game due to in-compatible)
